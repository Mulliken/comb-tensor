## About
**fishbonett** is a Python package for propagates the dynamics of multi-site vibronic model systems that have
fishbone-like configurations. The motivation of the fishbone-like configurations of this specific type
of models is very simple; we would like to study the dynamics of electron-transfer or excitation-energy-transfer
systems, each of which is coupled to two baths.
