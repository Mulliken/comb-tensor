## About
**fishbonett** is a Python package for propagating the dynamics of multi-site vibronic model systems that have
fishbone-like configurations. The motivation of the fishbone-like configurations of this specific type
of models is very simple; we would like to study the dynamics of electron-transfer or excitation-energy-transfer
systems, in which each electronic or vibrational site is coupled to a bath.
